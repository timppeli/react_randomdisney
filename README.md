# React Exercise: Random Disney Character Data

## Known bugs, grievances & "i-give-up"s
- API: some image urls are broken > no image to display
- API: some entries missing > sometimes you have to reroll to get a new character
- no error messages for the grievances mentioned above
- nor real error handling in general
- great big plans for a search by name function, very little success in implementing it in time (see: Resources #4)
